                Photosynthesis is the process by which
                green plants and some other organisms
                use sunlight to synthesize foods with
                the help of chlorophyll. It typically
                takes place in the chloroplasts of 
                plant cells. During this process, 
                plants absorb carbon dioxide from the
                air and water from the soil. Using 
                energy from sunlight, they convert 
                these into glucose (a type of sugar) 
                and release oxygen as a byproduct. 
                This process is essential not only 
                for plant growth but also for providing
                 the oxygen we breathe."</h1>
